# Shiny App Projects  

This repository contains two Shiny applications:  

1. **[UI-Only App](https://giacomobizzotto.shinyapps.io/UI_FirstShinyApp/)** – A Shiny application that focuses on building the user interface without server-side functionality.  
2. **[UI & Server App](https://giacomobizzotto.shinyapps.io/FinalProjectApp/)** – A fully functional Shiny application that integrates both UI and server components to enable dynamic interactivity.  

These projects demonstrate the flexibility of Shiny in building web applications for data visualization and user interaction.
